				<h2 style="margin-top: 0px; line-height: 25px;">Your Mission</h2>
				<p>
					Children are evil! They are dirty, loud and full of shit. So we - the Scarefactory - hired the
					most horrifying monsters you can get for money.<br />
					Your mission is to scare the shit out of these little brats. But be careful! TV and videogames
					dulled the youth and made it really difficult for our company to server extra quality scares.<br />
					<br />
					For each successful near-to-death scared child you will get a reward called "Scare Credits".
					Monsters are a bit whiny these days. So it may appear that they will quit the job if childs are not
					scared enough.<br />
					But enough blabla. Let's get serious. <strong>How does your scare-center work</strong>?
				</p>
				<p>
					Don't worry, your work won't bee too hard. All you have to do is to show your monsters
					where to go and scare a child. Therefore just drag the monster you chose to a marked point
					on the big blue marble.<br />
					<img src="assets/manual/img_01.jpg" width="500" style="margin: 5px 0px;"/><br />
					You can rotate the globe by holding your right mouse button and move your mouse. 
					That way you will discover more and more too big mouthed children who deserve a real good
					scare.<br />
					<img src="assets/manual/img_02.jpg" width="500" style="margin: 5px 0px;"/><br />
					Alright, since you learned the basic movements, here is a tip for you. It's really
					hard to survive in the scare-business. Good luck we invented a scanner that scans 
					our victims for vulnerabilities.<br /> 
					<img src="assets/manual/img_03.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 5px;"/>
					So you can not only see their ugly faces but also
					the name, what age they are and what they fear the most.<br /><br />
					Try to use monsters those stinking bags of whinyness fear the most. If the level of your 
					monsters are too low, the chances to get the child scared will drop. 
					That's definitly not what you want. So here is another hint: Kids in the dark will be more
					easy to scare than at daylight. Look at the night side on the earth to find the easiest targets.<br />
					<br />
					<img src="assets/manual/img_04.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 5px;"/>
					If you are good, your monsters will become better and better. From time to time they level up
					and learn how to scare older children. But that also means they will cost more per day.<br />
					If you can't pay them these traitors will quit and you have to hire newbies.<br />
					<br />
					Monsters are not only highly expensive, they also need a lot of rest (those lazy creeps!). 
					After scaring a child they need to recover emotionally from this experience. So you have to
					give them a bit of time until you can use them again.<br />
					<br />
					Oh and one more thing: If you loose all your monsters and can't afford to hire a new one,
					we see this as a total fail. In that case we don't see an other option than to fire you...<br />
					... or feed you to the monsters.<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					And now go and scare some childs. They deserve it.
